    CS2 Server Creator allows you to set up servers for CS2 in an easy, fast, and intuitive manner.<br>
    It's a project based on the well-known <a href="https://github.com/DioJoestar/SteamCMD-GUI#steamcmd-gui">SteamCMD GUI</a>.<br><br>
    <strong>The code is not related or tied to that project in any way.</strong><br><br>
    This application allows for modification of common files for server setup, as well as the generation of files such as autoexec.cfg to further configure the server.

## Tutorial

### Step 1: Srcds Configuration
Select the directory of the `cs2.exe`. For example: 
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\bin\win64`

### Step 2: Server Name
To modify this section, you must have generated the `autoexec.cfg` using the button on the right.

### Step 3: Server Password
Similar to the `Server Name`, you need to have the `autoexec.cfg` created.

### Step 4: Map
Choose the map for your server. (Future compatibility with workshop maps is planned.)

### Step 5: Network
Not Available Yet.

### Step 6: Gamemode
Select the desired game mode. Remember, based on the game mode you choose, you will need to modify the respective CFGs.

### Step 7: UDP Port
Select the server port.

### Step 8: Max Players
Set the maximum number of players for the server (Up to 64).

### Step 9: Disable Bots
Turn off the server bots.

### Step 10: Autoexec
Enable or disable the execution of `autoexec`.
