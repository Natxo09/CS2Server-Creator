<p align="center">
    CS2 Server Creator allows you to set up servers for CS2 in an easy, fast, and intuitive manner.<br>
    It's a project based on the well-known <a href="https://github.com/DioJoestar/SteamCMD-GUI#steamcmd-gui">SteamCMD GUI</a>.<br><br>
    <strong>The code is not related or tied to that project in any way.</strong><br><br>
    This application allows for modification of common files for server setup, as well as the generation of files such as autoexec.cfg to further configure the server.
